Ipv6 steps on routers:
1. Enable ipv6 routing engine by "ipv6 unicast-routing"
2. Enter the interface and un shutdown it
3. Enter the sub interface
4. Tell it the vlan that dealing with by "encapsulation dot1q 'vlan-id' "
5. Give it ipv6 by "ipv6 address --/64"
6. Optional: give it link local ip by "ipv6 address -- link-local"
7. Modify the RA message to use stateless dhcp by "ipv6 nd other-config-flag"
8. Tell it the dhcp server by "ipv6 dhcp server 'pool-name' "

Ipv6 steps on switchs:
1. Enable the ipv6 engine by "sdm prefer dual-ipv4-and-ipv6 default"
2. Save the configuration by "do wr"
3. Reload the switch by "do reload"
4. Enable ipv6 routing engine by "ipv6 unicast-routing"
5. Enter the vlan interface 
6. Assign it the ip by "ipv6 address --"
7. Exit and tell the switch getaway by "ipv6 route ::/0 'getway-ip' "

IPv6 Tunneling steps between two routers (must be configured on two routers):
1. specify the tunnel interface by "int tunnel 'id' "
2. specify the mode by "tunnel mode ipv6ip"
3. specify the source ipv4 for encapsulation by "tunnel source 'public-interface-name' "
4. specify the destination ipv4 for encapsulation by  "tunnel destination 'public-interface-ipv4' "
5. assign the tunnel interface ipv6 address by "ipv6 address '' "
6. do static routing for the remote tunnel interface by "ipv6 route 'subnet/64' 'remote-tunnel-ip' "

notes:
ipv6 address assigned to the two interfaces must be from the same subnet
